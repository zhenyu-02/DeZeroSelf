## About This Project

This is my personal practice repository for the book "[Deep Learning from Scratch 3: Building a Framework](https://www.oreilly.co.jp/books/9784873119069/)".

This repository contains the code I wrote and modified while following the book.
## Directory Contents

| Directory | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [dezero](/dezero) | Source code for DeZero |
| [dezeroSelf](/dezeroSelf/) | My implement of DeZero |
| [examples](/examples) | Examples developed using DeZero |
| [steps](/steps) | Code files for each step (step01.py to step60.py) , Also contains my Code with _self |
| [tests](/tests) | Unit tests for DeZero |


## Required Libraries

This book uses the following Python version and external libraries:

- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Additionally, DeZero provides an optional feature to run on NVIDIA's GPU. In that case, you will need to install the following library:

- [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/) (optional)


## How to Run

The Python files explained in the book are mainly in the [steps](/steps) directory.
You can run these files with the following Python commands (you can run them from any directory).

```
$ python steps/step01.py
$ python steps/step02.py

$ cd steps
$ python step31.py
```
